# MarketBeacon: Real-Time Financial Data Aggregation and Analysis

MarketBeacon is a high-performance, low-latency system designed to aggregate and analyze real-time financial market data from multiple sources. Built with Rust for speed, reliability, and memory safety, MarketBeacon provides a robust platform for quantitative analysis, algorithmic trading, and risk management. It enables users to ingest, process, and disseminate market information with minimal delay, allowing for informed decision-making in dynamic market conditions.

This project aims to address the increasing demands for speed and accuracy in financial data processing. Modern financial markets operate at incredible speeds, requiring sophisticated tools capable of handling massive data streams in real-time. MarketBeacon offers a solution by leveraging Rust's concurrency features and memory management capabilities to create a highly efficient and scalable data processing pipeline. It supports various data formats and protocols, ensuring compatibility with different market data providers and analytical systems.

MarketBeacons core functionality revolves around its ability to seamlessly integrate with diverse data sources, perform complex calculations on the fly, and expose processed data via multiple channels. The system architecture is designed for modularity and extensibility, allowing users to customize the data processing logic and integrate with existing infrastructure. By utilizing asynchronous programming and parallel processing, MarketBeacon maximizes throughput and minimizes latency, providing a competitive edge in today's fast-paced financial markets.

**Key Features**

*   **Multi-Source Data Ingestion:** Supports simultaneous ingestion from multiple market data providers (e.g., FIX, WebSocket, REST APIs). Implemented using asynchronous I/O with the `tokio` runtime for efficient network communication.
*   **Real-Time Data Processing:** Processes incoming market data in real-time, performing calculations such as moving averages, volatility estimates, and order book aggregation. Utilizes Rust's powerful iterator chains and data structures (e.g., `HashMap`, `BTreeMap`) for optimized performance.
*   **Customizable Data Transformations:** Provides a flexible framework for defining custom data transformations and calculations using a plugin-based architecture. Implemented using Rust's `dyn Trait` feature to allow dynamic loading of transformation modules.
*   **Low-Latency Performance:** Designed for ultra-low latency, minimizing the time between data arrival and analysis output. Achieved through careful optimization of data structures, algorithms, and network protocols.
*   **Data Persistence (Optional):** Offers optional data persistence to store historical market data for backtesting and analysis. Supports various database backends (e.g., PostgreSQL, TimescaleDB) through the `diesel` ORM.
*   **WebSocket API:** Exposes processed data via a WebSocket API for real-time consumption by client applications. Implemented using the `warp` web server framework for robust and scalable API delivery.
*   **Comprehensive Error Handling:** Includes robust error handling and logging to ensure data integrity and system stability. Utilizes the `tracing` crate for structured logging and performance monitoring.

**Technology Stack**

*   **Rust:** The core programming language, chosen for its speed, memory safety, and concurrency features.
*   **Tokio:** An asynchronous runtime for Rust, used for managing concurrent tasks and I/O operations.
*   **Warp:** A web server framework for Rust, used for building the WebSocket API.
*   **Diesel:** An ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) for Rust, used for interacting with databases.
*   **Tracing:** A structured logging and tracing library for Rust, used for monitoring system performance and debugging.
*   **Serde:** A serialization and deserialization framework for Rust, used for handling data formats like JSON and MessagePack.

**Installation**

1.  Ensure you have Rust installed. If not, install it from [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
2.  Clone the repository:
    `git clone https://github.com/uhsr/MarketBeacon.git`
3.  Navigate to the project directory:
    `cd MarketBeacon`
4.  Build the project:
    `cargo build --release`
5.  The executable will be located in the `target/release` directory.

**Configuration**

MarketBeacon uses environment variables for configuration. Create a `.env` file in the project root directory with the following variables:

*   `DATA_SOURCE_TYPE`: The type of data source (e.g., "FIX", "WebSocket", "REST").
*   `DATA_SOURCE_URL`: The URL or connection string for the data source.
*   `DATABASE_URL`: The URL for the database (if data persistence is enabled).
*   `WEBSOCKET_PORT`: The port number for the WebSocket API.
*   `LOG_LEVEL`: The logging level (e.g., "debug", "info", "warn", "error").

Example `.env` file:

DATA_SOURCE_TYPE=WebSocket
DATA_SOURCE_URL=ws://example.com/marketdata
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/marketbeacon
WEBSOCKET_PORT=8080
LOG_LEVEL=info

**Usage**

Run the MarketBeacon executable from the `target/release` directory:

`./target/release/marketbeacon`

The application will start ingesting data from the configured data source, processing it, and exposing it via the WebSocket API.

Example WebSocket client connection using Javascript:



The WebSocket API sends processed market data as JSON messages. The exact format of the messages depends on the configured data transformations.
